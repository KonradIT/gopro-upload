#Uploader to local dir

First, you will need to CD the directory where you want to save the pictures, so I recommend a hard drive, then you can paste the code.

###Settings for your GoPro:
* First turn it on and use the DELETE ALL function to format the camera
* Turn it off
* Press the shutter button
* Keep pressing the shutter button while you press the power button
* When its on, release the shutter button and power button

####Next...
* Install the [hack](autoexec.ash). Check [this](https://vimeo.com/91791285) and [this](http://git.io/P76lMQ)

###Settings for your computer (using linux)
* Install wget ```sudo apt-get install wget```

###Script settings

Change *GoPro_SSID* by the GoPro Wifi name that you typed when you updated the camera

Change *GoPro_PASSWORD* by the GoPro Wifi password that you typed when you updated the camera
