First, you will need to CD the directory where you want to save the pictures, so I recommend a hard drive, then you can paste the code.

###Settings for your GoPro:
* First turn it on and use the DELETE ALL function to format the camera
* Turn it off
* Press the shutter button
* Keep pressing the shutter button while you press the power button
* When its on, release the shutter button and power button

####Next...
* Install the (autoexec.ash)[hack]. Check (https://vimeo.com/91791285)[this] and (http://git.io/P76lMQ)[this]

###Settings for your computer (using linux)
